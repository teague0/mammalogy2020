### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. In general it emphasizes the text you write over the code you write. 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

### Back to Mammals

In case we need the mammal data again, here is the code from what we just went over in class. 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
mammals <- read.csv("https://github.com/teague0/mammalogy2020/raw/master/data/PanTheriaData.csv")
```

#### How to complete the homework

You will be given a description of the plot that I'm looking for and partial code to complete it. You can use whatever resources you need (copying previous code is a great idea) to finish the code & produce a plot. You'll generally get asked some questions about that plot or to interpret what you see.

```{r , echo=FALSE}

```
